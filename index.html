        <p>
            I've always wanted to make you a special gift. Since I know how much of a creative
            person you are, I wanted to try my best to make something meaningful in my own way.
            I hope you like it!

            <h2>A Little Note for My Favorite Person</h2>
            <p id="intro">
                Dear Pakkun ,</p>

            <p id="body">
                Happy Birthday!! I hope your time in Dallas was everything you wished for and more. I dont know why you
                decided you wanted to COOK and read for your birthday LOL but I hope it was fun. You gave me one of
                the best birthday Ive ever had, and I can only hope yours was just as amazing. Thinking back to when
                we started talking again, I remember feeling so lucky that I had another chance with you. You reminded
                me
                right away why I admired you so much in the past: your personality, your kindness, and the way we were
                able
                to talk to each other for hours and days and weeks without running out of things to talk about.

                I know Ive made mistakes in the past, and I genuinely regret the times I wasnt the person that you
                deserved.
                But more than anything, Im grateful for you. I'm grateful for the laughs weve shared, the memories we
                made, and
                the way youve inspired me to be a better person, whether it be for myself or for someone else. Youve
                always been
                someone so special in my life, and I want nothing but happiness and success for you. You deserve the
                very best that
                life has to offer. I am wishing happiness and success for you!!

                And maybe it's wishful thinking but I cant help holding onto the hope that one day we will find each
                other again and
                everything will work out between us. What we had, and still have, feels so real and Ive never felt a
                connection like this
                with anyone else. Maybe Im delusional and being a burden to you, but I believe in soulmates and the red
                string that ties
                two people together no matter the distance or time apart. No matter what, I will always love you. Here's
                to the upcoming
                year, I hope it treats you well.<br><br>
